The LibFakeTime library adds filter to function time().

Dynamicaly linked programs which checking time using time() or gettimeofday()
will report fake time... so it is possible to send e-mail to friend with
date of his birth after this date... if we forgot... ;-P

You can also use it to warp time in xclock. Or to make you program works
after expiration date (but this is obviusly illegal).

For more information (about using library) see doc/libfaketime.html.

I used some code from:
 - Anubis : http://www.gnu.org/projects/anubis/,
 - libsafe : http://www.bell-labs.com/org/11356/libsafe.html,

To build the library:
        make            (This will make libfaketime.so.0)
        make install    (make install must be done as root)

LibFakeTime library have two configure option (see Makefile),
     -DDEBUG            (This enable _very_ noisy debug code,
        (optional)       not very useful for normal users, just for programers)
     -DKILLER           (This enable killer code,
        (optional)       if library cannot read fake code from file,
                         it will kill your process. Useful with programs
                         writting timestamps - cannot get fake time,
                         prevent program from make timestamp.
                         DANGER: IT CAN KILL YOUR INIT WHEN BOOTING !!!)

The makefile will only copy the library and man page to the appropriate
directories.  To activate libfaketime, either on a per-process basis or on a
system-wide basis, see the man page (libfaketime.8, Section "Installing
libfaketime").
